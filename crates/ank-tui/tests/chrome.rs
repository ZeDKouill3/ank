//! What the frame spends on furniture, through the binary, at the five windows
//! the criterion names (TASK-9a402a54886f).
//!
//! The frame was redrawn against a measurement and this suite is that
//! measurement, kept: at eighty columns and twenty-four rows the reader spent
//! three rows on a header, one on a note band, one on a band of touch targets
//! and two on key lines cut with `~` before they finished -- and the two lines
//! teaching the keys did not fit on the screen they were taught from. The
//! answer was to take the offer out of the frame and put it behind a
//! permanently visible target carved out of the header, and the number
//! it has to hold to afterwards is [`CHROME`].
//!
//! **Counted through the binary, on a pseudo-terminal, at every window the
//! criterion states.** CLAUDE.md leaves no choice about that: a criterion that
//! talks about the binary is tested through the binary, and a row count is a
//! claim about a process reading a real terminal's size. `src/view.rs` asserts
//! what the layout function answers; this asserts what a person sees.
//!
//! **The terminal, the corpus and the driven session are `terminal/mod.rs`**,
//! which `tests/region.rs` explains and three other suites here declare.
