//! Screen 3 is GRAPH, and it draws the `blocked_by` DAG as lanes, through
//! the binary, at the desk and on the dashboard (TASK-a9cd362ee5e2,
//! TASK-643611645dea, ADR-ac6be1ebe9aa).
//!
//! The digit, the ring and the title moved first: `3` reaches the graph,
//! `Tab` walks claims, entities, graph and queue, and the document is what a
//! row opens into, titled `BODY` with no digit in front. Then the graph was
//! drawn into the panel: one row per task shown, placed by the layout module
//! above everything it is blocked by, with the cell saying finished, open or
//! under way, the word beside the identifier saying readiness, and a row of
//! it opening that task's document. Then the rows were gathered into blocks
//! (TASK-de02dbcf9965): one per group of linked tasks on the junction lanes,
//! a blank between two, the tasks linked to nothing last under a heading,
//! and the cursor walking task rows only.
//! `src/view.rs` asserts each of those of the render and of the key table on
//! every platform; this asserts them of `ank tui` on a pseudo-terminal, at
//! the two windows the criterion names -- eighty by twenty-four, which is
//! under [`ank_tui::view::DASHBOARD`] and draws one region, and a hundred and
//! sixty by forty-five, which draws the listings in a left column beside the
//! right panel.
//!
//! **What a read costs is counted and never timed.** `ANK_TRACE_READS` is
//! pointed at an absolute path, every verb the reader spawns appends one
//! `index` line to it on a warm corpus (measured on 2026-10-14: `find`,
//! `graph`, `status` and `review` one each, `show` one plus an `entity` line
//! per file it parsed), and the file is compared before and after the keys.
//! A key that spawned a read would grow it; the keys that move a cursor
//! leave it byte for byte.
//!
//! Every session here is `#[cfg(unix)]` for the reason every sibling suite
//! gives: a pseudo-terminal on Windows is ConPTY, and reaching it means the
//! console API this workspace does not otherwise call. **The instrument that
//! reads the frame is not** (TASK-44e35bd40c83): [`graph_rows`] is pure text,
//! and it is held to a literal frame on every platform, so the one piece of
//! this suite that every PTY count rests on is measured where the suite was
//! written and not only where it runs.

// What only the sessions call is unused where the sessions are not compiled.
